### My First Week

The Iron Yard has been quite the experience thus far. Ive met a lot of like-minded, motivated, and smart people who have all made the decision to change their lives and follow their passion in the tech industry.
It's very exciting to see how excited everyone is to really dig in and get their minds wrapped around how to code and develop. One of the best parts about the class is just how open everyone is to helping each other out.
We are all from different backgrounds and have different experiences, but it's not stopping anyone from being there for their classmates. 

The course structure is also something that I enjoy about attending The Iron Yard. David, our instructor, guides us along the path without holding our hands too much. It's a nice balance of instruction and sink or swim. We've been bombarded with information the last few days but I feel like I'm getting a pretty firm grasp on what we've worked on so far.

I'm excited to keep moving forward and really get to building my own little piece of the internet.
